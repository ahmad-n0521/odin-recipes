    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pancakes! A breakfast food that is simple to make. 
        Personally, I don't eat this too frequently as it is a bit unhealthy.
    </p>
    <p>Original recipe "borrowed" from 'dakota kelly' of <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21014/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/" rel="noreferrer">allrecipes.com</a></p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
