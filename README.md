# Odin Project: Recipes

This project is a simple HTML website featuring recipes of food I like.

Upon completion of this project, I've demonstrated that I learned how to:
- Create a simple HTML website
- Create pages other than the index.html 
- Include links, lists, and images to my website
- Use Git and GitHub to host my project
